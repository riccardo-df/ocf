## Correct Problems
I was asked to correct a couple of problems in order to safely retain my package on CRAN.

The first set of problems was generated by some tests. As these were no longer needed, I removed them.

The second problem was generated by C++ standards I was using. In particular, I was looking for C++20, C++17 and C++14 support 
while specifying R >= 3.1. The issue is that C++14/17 support was only added in R 3.4.0. I now specify R >= 3.4.0.
