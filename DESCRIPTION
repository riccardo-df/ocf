Title: Ordered Correlation Forest
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Riccardo", "Di Francesco", email = "difrancesco.riccardo96@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"))
Description: Machine learning estimator specifically optimized for handling ordered non-numeric outcomes. 
    OCF provides forest-based estimation of the conditional choice probabilities and the covariatesâ€™ marginal effects.
    Under an "honesty" condition, the estimates are consistent and asymptotically normal, and standard errors can be obtained 
    by leveraging the weight-based representation of the random forest predictions.
