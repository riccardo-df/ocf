Description: Machine learning estimator specifically optimized for predictive modeling of ordered non-numeric outcomes. 'ocf' provides forest-based estimation of the 
    conditional choice probabilities and the covariatesâ€™ marginal effects. Under an "honesty" condition, the estimates are consistent and asymptotically normal 
    and standard errors can be obtained by leveraging the weight-based representation of the random forest predictions. Please reference the use as Di Francesco (2025)
