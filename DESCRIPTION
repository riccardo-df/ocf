Description: 'morf' modifies the splitting criterion and prediction method of a standard random forest to 
    estimate conditional choice probabilities. It also implements a nonparametric estimators of the
    marginal effects. Standard errors are computed via a weight-based approach that, under some
    conditions such as honesty and subsampling, allows the user to conduct approximate inference.
